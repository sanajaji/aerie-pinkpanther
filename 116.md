## <p><span>Context</span></p> ##

The Cult of Mortys is a very special worship originating in the city of Arsinoe. They worship the dead and take care of their embalming. But then the dead rise, for fear of being banned in the city, they are seeking adventurers to recover the situation without alerting the authorities of the city.

3- You'll have to take some time by creating barricades to keep the zombies behind the barricades. You can rebuild them at any time (if you have enough points) to plug the loopholes.
