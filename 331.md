## <p><span>Context</span></p> ##

You're now in the city of Arsinoe, but you promised to help Daphnis with his patron who seems to want to hurry hime ...

## <p>Progress</p> ##

1- Daphnis have arranged a meet with you in a bar of Arsinoe where he would meet his contact. (ars\_in02,139,285) After a brief meeting with his contact, he will give you insight into the nature of his mission. He must steal an artifact in an old temple in the western region of Arsinoe : Lalibela. You should go there.

2- You must exit through the West Gate of Arsinoe which will lead you in the Gondar region: The Red Forest (ars\_fild23) and then head for the North to enter in the Canyon (ars\_fild57). From there you should take the east road to finally arrive at Lalibela. Daphnis is near the temple entrance. (ars\_fild21,225,129)

3- Daphnis tells you about a priest who spent the night behind the door ... If for you it's still daylight, you need to go in this area between 8:00 pm to 8:00 am. Priest Merley (ars\_fild21,237,149) you talk about the flight of the Holy Family to the crater of Gondar due to invisible threats. You must find him in his house a little further north and at the same time open a savepoint with a member of the Order of Tyr.

4- You will find the Priest Merley near his house (ars\_fild21,144,329), He speaks about the Timkat and the epiphany of the God of Lalibela. You must find Ann and Zachary who hid in the crater of Gondar and are surely in danger because they would have had to return to Lalibela a few days ago. To get to the crater of Gondar, you must return to the Red Forest and follow the track to discover the entrance to the crater of Gondar.

5- Enter into the crater in the house and talk to Petroloneko (ars\_in03, 105.45), he will not teachs you anything. But watching the play carefully you can see a secret passage in a wall leading to a bell. Return ask Petroloneko about this secret passage, learning that you are on a mission for the Priest Merlay, he admits that he hides the Holy Family, but he can't reach them... sacrabas depths blocking the path and the fate of the Holy Family is unknown to him.

6- You must eliminate the Queen of Scabaras then save the Holy Family who is safe and sound! Anne will give you a price for your bravery and look forward to seeing you at the temple for the epiphany of Lalibela, a very rare phenomenon and a harbinger of great change.
