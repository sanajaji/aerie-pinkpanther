<p>2- Now you need materials to make false papers. You need ink and paper that can provide Raichor in the port city of Thebes. Return to Soknobeus (ars_fild03) then take the south-east road.

<p>3- Here things get complicated ... You must reach the farm Eupator <a href='ars_fild19.md'>ars_fild19</a> but the tunnel is blocked you will have to travel around the mountain through the Bacchias Mounts. Return to Euhemeria then head towards the Northeast. You are now at the Abbey of Feymour (ars_fild07), continue east to reach the Citadel of Light (ars_fild16). There you will find a boatman [ars_fild16,152,144], which help you to cross the Crystalmir Lake. Crystalmir is a small fishing village in the Bacchias Mounts <a href='ars_fild20.md'>ars_fild20</a>, take the path east. You have finally reached the Eupator farm ! Rick Eupator (ars_fild19,137,128) to propose refinement of the ink if you bring 140 units of octopus forests ink. </ p><br>

<p>4- Octopuses are around the farm. Once the 140 units of ink go talk to Rick Eupator, he will them into a Purified Ink Vermillion. Bring ink to Raichor (ars_fild18,153,49). He will ask you to provide 400 pieces of currency of Arsinoe to finalize the transaction. Now we must go back to Philerme at Euhemeria. </ p><br>
