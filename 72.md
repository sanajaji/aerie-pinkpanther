## <p><span>Context</span></p> ##

You have access to Hylarheim which is the west side of Arsinoe, where the Hylar dwarves live. It seems that their village is plagued by long trouble.


## <p>Progress</p> ##

1- The village is being converted to the true faith by the missionaries of Tyr, you learn by talking about a Stronghold, the Fort Storm, who is unresponsive. Many Hylars keep that up against hacker attacks and no income is over. Brother Jude (ars\_fild33,101,121) asks you to go to the Father Superior Malachie to Arsinoe for it to provide troops for an assault on the place.

3- Yadie (ars\_fild22,295,96) is ready to sail with a squadron of knights of Harpocrates and equipment for Hylar. It's time to drive the Da'Urdein out of the Fort Storm! She will offer to take you to Hylarheim from there by contacting the Marine Hylar you will be transported to the fortress.

4- You're on the edge of the galley ready to start instance "Strong Storm"! A force field prevents you from achieving their leader, for that you'll have to destroy initially incantations Lich.
