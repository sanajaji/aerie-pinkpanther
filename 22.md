## <p><span>Context</span></p> ##

<p>You are finally at a small village in the south of Arsinoe : Coppalanna. Guellronoc'h just landed you there. The road looks even longer to reach the capital. </p>

## <p>Progress</p> ##

<p>1- You must find your guide in Coppalana : Daphnis [coppa,231,124]. He tells you that you must leave the area of Coppalana, you need an authorization from the Chief of the Village, then cross the Daggard's Bridge. The village chief is the Chief Rafloc'h  (coppa,235,163), He's on the central square of the village. He tells us that the spirit of the village, Boitata, is angry and destroyed the bridge Daggard, which prevents you from leaving the area. </p>

<p>2- You'll have to calm the boitata then the bridge will be able to be rebuilt. Shaman Xaviral (coppa,95,55) tells you how to invoke the boitata. You should just contact Kloiacha via an underpass. (coppa,59,87) </p>

<p>Once the battle is over a message will appear telling you to go back to the Chief of Coppalana. As in most instances of Arsinoe, you got two minutes to leave the room (here the tunnel) to complete the quest. So go and don't lost time !<br>
