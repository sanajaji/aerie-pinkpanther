## <p><span>Context</span></p> ##

Northern Arsinoe is a vast desert, the desert Kargah. For centuries, settlers from Arsinoe took land of goblins, pushing them into the most desolate regions. Revenge has sounded, the goblins troops are marching and are almost at the North Gate of Arsinoe


## <p>Progress</p> ##

1- Arsinoe troops are in bad shape, three legions were sent into the countryside of Terkish, unfortunately the losses were very heavy. The fourth and last legion of Arsinoe is itself blocked by La Rana. General Athanase (ars\_fild06,57,67) is located at Gate of Istar. He recruited mercenaries, and everything he can to strengthen the ranks of soldiers of Arsinoe. To receive your condition you should contact the Seneschal Lin on Lime's Torn-Thalas.

2- You must go to the North Gate of Arsinoe (ars\_fild09), either directly through Arsinoe, either through the mountains Bacchias (taking the road west from the abbey of the Col du Feymour). The Seneschal Lin (ars\_fild09,130,62) accepts you, you must merge with a garrison of Octavia's Pass commanded by Commander Paraclet.

3- Commander Paraclet (ars\_fild08,82,62) has no choice but to obey, despite the fact that it has virtually no troops under his command to guard the pass of Octavia (ars\_fild08) of bandits Bacchias Mountains. You must report that men of Octavia are running to the front.

4- You are now integrated into the Legion of Arsinoe III as auxiliary troops. Your first mission will be given to the Bastion of the lime-Torn Thalas. The front is located along the Torn-Thalas, you will need to conduct a final counter-offensive.

5- The instance of "The Lime-Thalas Torn" has just begun. Your first step will be to take the PC by eliminating a Goblin Hero. Then go to the camp prisoners to rally to your cause in motivating the prisoner Capeau. Then you must take the road North-East for the keys of the prison, killing the guard.

6- Once keys are obtained, return to the camp prisoners. But during that time reinforcements arrived, including the elite troops of General Toadinne. This time a battle of the trenches will begin! General Toadinne must die once dropped you must hurry to go to the Desert Kargah to liberate the village of Nesos (ars\_fild11) and establish a new defense a little further Arsinoe.
